# select N Random Lines From File
-----------------------------

This test plan contains a Java script that selects N random lines from an input file and saves them to an output file.

I tried to use the fastest techniques to: load the input file, then to randomly select N-given lines and finally to write the results to the output file.

Hope you'll like it :)
