# select N Random Lines From File
-----------------------------

This test plan contains a Java script that selects N random lines from an input file and saves them to an output file.
It does that on per thread basis, which means that each thread will create it's own random datafile

This template should work fine with a reasonable number of threads and reasonable number of N random lines. Please check the load generator resource usage before using it on live.

Hope you'll like it :)
